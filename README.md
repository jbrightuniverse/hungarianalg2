A Python 3 implementation of the Hungarian Algorithm for optimal matching in bipartite weighted graphs, upgraded to run faster.

Based on the graph theory implementation in [these notes](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~golin/COMP572/Notes/Matching.pdf) combined with the matrix interpretation in [these notes](https://montoya.econ.ubc.ca/Econ514/hungarian.pdf). Also derives from [these](https://github.com/jbrightuniverse/FastHungarianAlgorithm) [repos](https://github.com/jbrightuniverse/hungarianalg).

For a detailed overview, see [this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jbrightuniverse/Hungarian-Algorithm-No.-5/blob/main/HungarianAlgorithm.ipynb).

# Usage

Installation: `pip3 install hungarianalg`

Import: `from hungarianalg.alg import hungarian`

Function call: `result = hungarian(matrix)`

Properties:
- Optimal Matching: `result.match`
- Revenues: `result.revenues`
- Row Weights: `result.row_weights`
- Col Weights: `result.col_weights`
- Total Revenue: `result.revenue_sum`

See `example.py` for a comprehensive example.

# Issues

IMPORTANT: Currently, support for decimals in the input matrix is unstable, as at large matrix dimensions, floating point errors propagate and cause the algorithm to fail to terminate. 

It is recommended instead to linearly scale the input matrix by a power of 10 to a set of whole numbers, run the algorithm, and then scale back to the original precision at the end.
